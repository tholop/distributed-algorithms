# Distributed Algorithms
Implementations of several distributed algorithms in Distalgo. Personal work realized for a graduate class at Ecole Polytechnique.

1. Introduction: simple Distalgo programs
2. Wave algorithms: Phase, Tarry, Tree
3. Leader algorithms: Itai-Rodeh
4. Snapshots and termination: Chandy-Lamport, Four Counters
5. Distributed MST Computation: Gallagher-Humblet-Spira
